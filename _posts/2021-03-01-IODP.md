## Background

DSDP/ODP/IODP has over 3600 sites in the ocean all around the world. We tried to interpolate the data from IODP according to the workflow of geological modeling in the petroleum industry to investigate some global patterns of submarine sediment's physical properties. 



## Methods

1. Learned basic information about IODP; 
2. **Wrote Python script** to stuck download date from the IDDP website;
3. **Preprocessed** the data to be the input for ArcGIS and managed it by SQL Server; 
4. Used Wavelet Transform to analyze data;



## Main Conclusions

1. The global map after interpolation shows that, vertically magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma spectrum of the sediment have cyclic properties related to carbon and oxygen isotopes. 
2. And we also obtained the global 3D models of PWL (P-wave velocity) and BD (bulk density) of the sediment through data fitting.
