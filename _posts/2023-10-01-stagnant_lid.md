## Background

Lithosphere thickness heterogeneity of terrestrial planets is observed on Mars and Venus. Its effect on Earth has been discussed a lot as “supercontinent heating”. We design a model to investigate its effect on short-wavelength stagnant-lid convection (the convection mode of Mars & Venus). 



## Skills used

1. Use ***\*ASPECT\**** to conduct 2D numerical modeling of Mars’s mantle convection; 
2. Add thicker lid as high viscosity composition by particle-in-cell method; 
3. Test different lithosphere & convection parameter.



## Main Conclusions

1) The thickened lithosphere depresses the development of downwelling below it to cause horizontal temperature difference (rather than directly insulation); 
2) The horizontal temperature difference can drive long-wavelength convection, which degree is controlled by the number of thick lithosphere, not by the extent of it. 
3) Surface stress state is affected by lithosphere thickness heterogeneity.
