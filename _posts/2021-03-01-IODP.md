## Background

DSDP/ODP/IODP has >3600 sites in the ocean all around the world. We try to interpolate the data from IODP according to the workflow of geological modeling in petroleum industry to investigate some global pattern of submarine sedimentâ€™s physical property. 



## Skills used

1. Learn basic information about IODP; 
2. **Write Python script** to stuck download date form IDDP website; 
3. **Preprocess** the data to be the input for ArcGIS and management them by SQL SERVER; 
4. Use Wavelet Transform to analyze date;



## Main Conclusions

1. The global map after interpolation shows that vertically, magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma spectrum have cyclic properties related to carbon and oxygen isotopes. 
2. And we also obtain the global 3D model of PWL(P-wave velocity) & BD(bulk density) through data fitting.
