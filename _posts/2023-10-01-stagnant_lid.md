## Background

Lithosphere thickness heterogeneity on terrestrial planets is observed on Mars and Venus. Its effect on Earth has been discussed a lot as "supercontinent heating". We designed a model to investigate its effect on short-wavelength stagnant-lid convection (the convection mode of Mars and Venus). 



## Methods

1. Used **ASPECT** to conduct 2D numerical modeling of Mars's mantle convection; 
2. Added thicker lid as high viscosity composition by particle-in-cell method; 
3. Tested different lithosphere and convection parameters.



## Main Conclusions

1. The thickened lithosphere depresses the development of downwelling below it to cause a horizontal temperature difference (rather than directly insulation);
2. The horizontal temperature difference can drive long-wavelength convection, whose degree is controlled by the number of thick lithospheres, not by the extent of the thick lithosphere.
3. Surface stress state is affected by lithosphere thickness heterogeneity.
