## Background

One of the theories to explain the origin of multi-plate tectonics proposed that the generation of plates can be caused by changes in the thickness of lithosphere during the Earth's thermal evolution. We design a model of mantle convection with dynamic lithosphere boundary to justify this theory.



## Skills used

1. Conduct **numerical modeling** of Earthâ€™s mantle convection with cylindrical geometry 
2. **Write an plugin** to set the lithosphere boundary at a fixed temperature using ASPECT; 
3. Test different Ra number; 
4. Compare results with cases without the dynamic lithosphere boundary



## Main Conclusions

1. The lithosphere thickness (under this definition) does change with time under steady state, but its amplitude is small (~5km when Ra~1e7), which is not sufficient to cause rift. 
2. Introducing a dynamic lithosphere boundary produce minor perturbation on thermal evolution.
